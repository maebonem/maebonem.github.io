	<p>Below are a few additional links that you may find helpful when checking for Section 508 compliance.</p>
	<ul class="resources">
	<li><a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section508.gov</a> the federal government's official site on Section 508 compliance. It contains resources on creating compliant documents, managing an internal compliance program, and verifying compliance in documents already prepared. It also offers a marketplace where vendors can buy and sell accessibility products and services. Their <a href="https://www.section508.gov/create/documents">Create Accessible Documents</a> page will be especially helpful if you do not plan to outsource the work. </li><br>
	<li><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508/making-files-accessible/checklist/word/index.html">HHS.gov</a>, the website for the department of Health and Human Services, has a checklist to run your documents through before publication. </li><br>
	<li>If you're a more visual learner, the YouTube channel Ideas that Work has  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ag9Bd9di8">a video tutorial</a> that takes you step by step through compliance verification.</li><br>
