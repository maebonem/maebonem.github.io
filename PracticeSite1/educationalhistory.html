	<h2>Educational History</h2>
	
	<p><b>George Mason University: Master of Arts in English.</b> (In Progress.)</p>
	<p>In the Master of Arts in English program at GMU, I continue to hone my reading comprehension, research skills, and writing abilities through courses that span a range of contemporary English studies.  In addition, I am pursuing a Concentration in Professional Writing and Rhetoric, which provides specialization in applying rhetorical theory to analyzing audiences and communication approaches for workplace writing applications.</p>
	
	<p>Completed Coursework:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Document Design: An introduction to reader-centered design for professional communicators.</li>
	<li>Technical Editing: A deep dive into improving grammar, clarity, and the overall quality of technical communications.</li>
	<li>Advanced Proposal Writing: An intensive course on finding grant and contract opportunities, evaluating the strength of the client's position in competing for them, and optimizing the argument for a client's suitability.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>Central Michigan University: Bachelor of Science in English.</b> Graduated 2010.</p>
	<p>I chose the Bachelor of Science track rather than the Bachelor of Arts because the general education foundation for this program was more well-rounded, providing a better basis for writing in professional spaces focused on a range of different subject matter.  My concentration was in World Literature.</p>
