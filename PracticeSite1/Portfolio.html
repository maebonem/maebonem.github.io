	<h2>A Note</h2>
	<p>Because the part of my career I have spent in technical writing has been in a professional services contract with a government client, most of my in-office work is not suitable for public distribution due to security concerns. However, below you can find a few products that are acceptable for public consumption, including some freelance work I completed for a private client. </p>
