		<h2 id="1">What Is Section 508?</h2>
		<p>Section 508 is a section of the Federal Code of Regulations that requires all public-facing electronic communictions produced by government entities, and many internal electronic communications, to be accessible to people with disabilities. </p>
		<h2 id="2">Why Is it Important?</h2>
		<p>Ensuring our documents are accessible to all of our audiences is a basic responsibility of being a communicator. Whether our readers are coworkers, customers, or concerned members of the public, we owe it to them to communicate in a format they can use.</p>
		<h2 id="3">Who Needs Accessible Documents?</h2>
		<p>When we're talking about electronic document accessibility, we typically mean users who interact with our documents through assistive technologyâ€”those who are visually impaired, hearing-impaired, or who have mobility issues that make it difficult to use traditional keyboards, mice, and other interface devices. But Section 508 covers a wide range of types of accessibility, up to and including color-blindness.</p>
