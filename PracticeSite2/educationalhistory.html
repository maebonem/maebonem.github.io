		<aside>In the Master of Arts in English program at GMU, I continue to hone my reading comprehension, research skills, and writing abilities through courses that span a range of contemporary English studies.  In addition, I am pursuing a Concentration in Professional Writing and Rhetoric, which provides specialization in applying rhetorical theory to analyzing audiences and communication approaches for workplace writing applications.</aside>

		<aside>I chose the Bachelor of Science track rather than the Bachelor of Arts because the general education foundation for this program was more well-rounded, providing a better basis for writing in professional spaces focused on a range of different subject matter.  My concentration was in World Literature.</aside>
