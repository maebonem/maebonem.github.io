	<h3>Conant Corporation</h3> 
	<section>
	<p><i>Court Reporting Production Specialist</i>, August 2012–March 2016.</p>
	<p>Conant is a Philadelphia small business that performs document production primarily for local law firms. I began with them in the actual mailroom, and was later tapped to take over the court reporting production side of the company's work.</p>
	<aside>Court reporters in Philadelphia are typically independent contractors, transcribing depositions and court proceedings and producing transcripts according to the needs of each particular case.  Because many of them work from home and lack the infrastructure for large-scale printing and formatting, they outsourced this labor to us at Conant. Each has his or her own taste, organizational approach, branding, and set of available services; law firms to which they delivered also had their own preferences. Working simultaneously with such a variety of client concerns was an excellent bootcamp in project management!</p>
	</aside>
		<ul>
			<li>Maintained client relationships and provided technical support for Conant's online file repository service</li>
			<li>Formatted, compiled, printed, and distributed deposition transcripts according to clients' specifications.</li>
		</ul>
