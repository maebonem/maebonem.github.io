<aside><b>A note:</b> Because the part of my career I have spent in technical writing has been in a professional services contract with a government client, most of my in-office work is not suitable for public distribution due to security concerns. However, I have provided a few products that are acceptable for public consumption, including some freelance work I completed for a private client.
