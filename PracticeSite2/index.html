	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>Thanks for visiting my professional site! I'm Mae Bonem, a professional writer and editor with five years of experience. I've worked as an editor in academic publishing and as a technical communicator for government and private sector clients. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Professional Writing and Rhetoric at George Mason, and I look forward to the new competencies I will gain and the new opportunities that will open up for me. </p>
